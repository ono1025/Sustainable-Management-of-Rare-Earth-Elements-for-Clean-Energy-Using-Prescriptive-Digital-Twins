# Sustainable-Management-of-Rare-Earth-Elements-for-Clean-Energy-Using-Prescriptive-Digital-Twins
Accepted at DigiTwin for MSSR 2024 (Purdue University), this repo presents a prescriptive digital twin framework for sustainable rare earth element (REE) extraction, focusing on energy efficiency, real-time data integration, and eco-friendly process optimization.
üîç Overview
Rare Earth Elements (REEs) like Neodymium (Nd) and Dysprosium (Dy) are critical to clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles and wind turbines. However, their extraction raises environmental, economic, and geopolitical concerns.

This work proposes a Prescriptive Digital Twin (DT) framework to make REE extraction processes more:

Energy-efficient

Environmentally sustainable

Resilient to supply chain disruptions

üß† Key Contributions
Five-stage Digital Twin model for mining, crushing, chemical processing, refinement, and waste management.

Real-time data integration using IoT for prescriptive analytics.

Optimization of chemical use, energy consumption, and tailings recycling.

A path toward circular economy practices in REE supply chains.

Future integration with Reinforcement Learning and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
